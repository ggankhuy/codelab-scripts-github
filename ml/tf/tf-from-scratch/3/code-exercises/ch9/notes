ch9-p227-enc-dec.py: points to remember:
    - initial hidden state of decode is the encoder's final state.
    - before, in ch8, we only used final hidden state to predict classification output (logits) 
      but now we run output of every of cell (or iteration) through a linear layer
      to convert each hidden state into predicted coordinates.
    - the predicted coordinates are then used for input of the 2nd step (x2)
