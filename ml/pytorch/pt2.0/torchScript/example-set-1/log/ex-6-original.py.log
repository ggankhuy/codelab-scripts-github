/root/gg/git/codelab/gpu/ml/pytorch/pt2.0/torchScript/example-set-1/./ex-6-original.py:10: TracerWarning: Converting a tensor to a Python boolean might cause the trace to be incorrect. We can't record the data flow of Python values, so this value will be treated as a constant in the future. This means that the trace might not generalize to other inputs!
